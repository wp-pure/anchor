## Anchor Shortcode
This plugin is very simple, so this readme doesn't need to be very long. Basically, it just gives you access to a new shortcode that will allow you to easily inject anchor links (`<a name="my-anchor"></a>`) into your content using a shortcode (so it can be edited without having to view the source of the page). Here's how you'd create an anchor inside your content.

```
[anchor id="my-anchor"]
```

And that's it. Now you can create a link anywhere else in the content of the page and just link it to `#my-anchor` and that link, when clicked, will move the user to whatever position on the page you added your anchor.
